1. For this it only takes one step which is to type "ssh cs15lfa23jb@ieng6.ucsd.edu" in order to login to ieng6.

1. This also only takes one step which is to type "git clone git@github.com:JoshCaneday/lab7.git" in order to clone my fork of the repository from my Github account.

1. This step also only takes one step as I only have to run the script to run the tests by typing "bash test.sh".

## Step 7

1. Type "vim ListExamples.java" to go into vim for the chosen file.
2. Press Shift and L at the same time to drop down to the bottom of the page quickly.
3.  ``` <up><up><up><up><up><up><end><left><left><left><left><left><left> ``` This manuevers to the correct spot to fix the error.
4. Press "r" to get ready to replace the current character without having to go into insert mode.
5. Press "2" to replace whatever was orignally on the cursor with the given character.
6. Press "escape", to get back into normal mode.
7. Type ":wq" to save and exit vim.

1. Once again, I only have type "bash test.sh" to run the script and run the tests.

## Step 9

1. Type "git add ListExamples.java" to get the file ready for committing.
2. Type "git commit ListExamples.java" to commit the changes.
3. Since the above step opens up vim, you have to type some message so that the commit is confirmed. A message that tells the user that a fix was made is recommended. I personally wrote "fixing listexamples", so that I knew that I fixed the code.
4. Type "git push" this will publish the changes to the fork on Github.
5. The changes should now be made.
