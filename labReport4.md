1. For this it only takes one step which is to type "ssh cs15lfa23jb@ieng6.ucsd.edu" in order to login to ieng6.

1. This also only takes one step which is to type "git clone git@github.com:JoshCaneday/lab7.git" in order to clone my fork of the repository from my Github account.

1. This step also only takes one step as I only have to run the script to run the tests by typing "bash test.sh".

1. Type "vim ListExamples.java"
2. Press Shift and L at the same time
3.  ``` <up><up><up><up><up><up><end><left><left><left><left><left><left> ```
4. Press "r"

1. Once again, I only have type "bash test.sh" to run the script and run the tests.

## Step 9

1. Type "git add ListExamples.java"
2. Type "git commit ListExamples.java"
3. Since the above step opens up vim, you have to type some message so that the commit is confirmed. A message that tells the user that a fix was made is recommended. I personally wrote "fixing listexamples", so that I knew that I fixed the code.
