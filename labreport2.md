# Part 2:

**Private Key**

There is more below the line ("-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----"). However, I will not show it for privacy reasons, and because the task says to only show the path not the actual key. I assume that was the intent. So, the path for the private key would be from the home directory into the /.ssh directory and into id_rsa. It should be noted that this was done on my own computer.

**Public Key**

The path would once again be from the home directory into the .ssh directory. However, in this case we would go into id_rsa.pub. It should be noted that this was done in my account on ieng6.

Above is the screenshot of me logging into ieng6 with my course-specific account without the need of using my password.

# Part 3:

Q: In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didnâ€™t know before.

A: One of the most interesting things that I had learned in week 2 was how to not only build but also run a server. I never knew how easy it was to do this. I find it really cool how people can connect if they go to the same port and server.
