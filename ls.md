## Using the ls Command Without an Argument

In this example, the working directory was "/home". I got this output because if you use the ls command without an argument, it just lists all the files and folders within the current working directory. In this case, the working directory was "/home". Since "lecture1" was the only thing within "/home", that was the only thing outputted. This command did not output an error.

## Using the ls Command With a Directory Argument

In this example, the working directory was "/home". This was the output because when using the ls command with a directory as an argument, it lists all the files and folders within the directory that was written. However, it should be noted that the directory that was written alongside the command must actually exist and also be written in the correct format. For example, if the directory was not within the current working directory, the user must name the directory using its absolute path. The output was not an error.

## Using the ls Command With a File Argument

In this example, the working directory was "/home/lecture1/messages". The output of this command was just itself because when you list the contents of a file, the only thing there is the file itself. A file is not a folder/directory and therefore does not contain any other files inside of it. The output was not an error.
