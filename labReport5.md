Hello, I'm having some trouble finding the number of lines in each of the files inside the Media directory for Lab 5. I cloned the docsearch repository and I'm trying to use the wc command but each time I run it, I get an error:

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I've typed wc and the file just like it is shown in the examples.

**Teacher's Assistant:**
Okay so what exactly is the path to the files inside of the Media directory? Try to go through each directory until you get to media.

What is an alternative to the relative path?

Hint: If it says that there is no such file or directory, then you most likely just have the path wrong.

**Student:**
Alright so I tried to find the absolute path to the files inside Media using the cd and ls commands and I got this.
