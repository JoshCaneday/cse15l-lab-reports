Hello, I'm having some trouble finding the number of lines in each of the files inside the Media directory for Lab 5. I cloned the docsearch repository and I'm trying to use the wc command but each time I run it, I get an error:

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I've typed wc and the file just like it is shown in the examples.

**Teacher's Assistant:**
Okay so what exactly is the path to the files inside of the Media directory? Try to go through each directory until you get to media.

What is an alternative to the relative path?

Hint: If it says that there is no such file or directory, then you most likely just have the path wrong.

**Student:**
Alright so I tried to find the absolute path to the files inside Media using the cd and ls commands and I got this.

**Reflection:**
Throughout my labs, I learned what vim was and how to use the git commands such as git add, git commit, and git push. When I first started using vim I didn't really like it because it was confusing and I would often find myself accidently pressing buttons and doing things that I didn't to do. I would also be unable to undo these mistakes as I couldn't figure out what keys to press. However, after practicing using vim in these labs, I not only learned how to use vim but what shortcuts to use to make things quicker and easier. As for the git commands, I learned that in order to update the edits I made to the files in a repository that I had opened in a terminal, I needed to use git add, git commit and git push. Prior to the labs I thought that the edits I made in the terminal were linked to the repository on GitHub and that they were saved automatically. Now I know that these git commands are essential.
