**Student:**
I'm having some trouble with this lab because I keep getting an error whenever I run `bash test.sh`. I'm trying to run these tests, but I can't seem to figure out what's wrong. Here's an image of the error:

I keep looking throughout the ListExamples.java but I can't seem to find anything.
**Teacher's Assistant:**
Okay so where does it say the failure is? Does the test perhaps tell you where the error is located?

Hint: Check line 44.

**Student:**
Oh okay that I didn't see that. I found that it was adding to the index1 variable instead of the index2 variable. I've now changed it and rerun `bash test.sh`:

**Reflection:**
Throughout my labs, I learned what vim was and how to use the git commands such as git add, git commit, and git push. When I first started using vim I didn't really like it because it was confusing and I would often find myself accidently pressing buttons and doing things that I didn't to do. I would also be unable to undo these mistakes as I couldn't figure out what keys to press. However, after practicing using vim in these labs, I not only learned how to use vim but what shortcuts to use to make things quicker and easier. As for the git commands, I learned that in order to update the edits I made to the files in a repository that I had opened in a terminal, I needed to use git add, git commit and git push. Prior to the labs I thought that the edits I made in the terminal were linked to the repository on GitHub and that they were saved automatically. Now I know that these git commands are essential.
